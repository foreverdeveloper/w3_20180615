<body>

<p>
In this example, we have created a fixed background image that will disappear slowly on scroll. Scroll the page to see the effect.
<strong>Note:</strong>
Try to remove the background-attachment property to really understand this example.

<div class="fixed-bg"></div>

<div style="height:800px;background-color:yellow;">
This div is only here to enable scrolling (height = 800 pixels).</div>
