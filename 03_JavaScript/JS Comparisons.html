<h2>JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators</h2>
<pre>
Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<pre>
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

Operator 	Description			Comparing	Returns
==		equal to			x == 8		false
						x == 5		true
						x == "5"	true
===		equal value and equal type	x === 5		true
						x === "5"	false
!=		not equal			x != 8		true
!==		not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false
						x !== "5"	true
						x !== 8		true
>		greater than			x > 8		false
<		less than			x < 8		true
>=		greater than or equal to	x >= 8		false
<=		less than or equal to		x <= 8		true
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<pre>
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
Given that x = 6 and y = 3, the table below explains the logical operators:
	Operator	Description	Example	Try it
	&&		and		(x < 10 && y > 1) is true
	||		or		(x == 5 || y == 5) is false
	!		not		!(x == y) is true
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Conditional (Ternary) Operator</h2>
<pre>
JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
Syntax
	variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2
	var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";
		If the variable age is a value below 18, the value of the variable voteable will be "Too young", otherwise the value of voteable will be "Old enough".
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Comparing Different Types</h2>
<pre>
When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false.
	Case		Value
	2 < 12		true
	2 < "12"	true
	2 < "John"	false
	2 > "John"	false
	2 == "John"	false
	"2" < "12"	false
	"2" > "12"	true
	"2" == "12"	false
To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison:
	age = Number(age);
	if (isNaN(age)) {
	    voteable = "Input is not a number";
	} else {
	    voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
	}
</pre>
<p>Input your age and click the button:</p>
<input id="age" value="18" />
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
<p id="demo"></p>
<hr/>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    var age, voteable;
    age = Number(document.getElementById("age").value);
    if (isNaN(age)) {
        voteable = "Input is not a number";
    } else {
        voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = voteable;
}
</script>
