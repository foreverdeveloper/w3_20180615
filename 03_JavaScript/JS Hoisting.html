<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<pre>
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

	x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

	elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
	elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element

	var x; // Declare x
</pre>
<p id="demo"></p>
<hr/>

<h2>JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted</h2>
<pre>
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
	var x1 = 5;  // Initialize x

	elem = document.getElementById("demo");            // Find an element
	elem.innerHTML = "x1 is " + x1 + " and y1 is " + y1;    // Display x and y

	var y1 = 7;  // Initialize y

This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7) is hoisted to the top.
Because of hoisting, y has been declared before it is used, but because initializations are not hoisted, the value of y is undefined.
</pre>
<p id="demo1"></p>
<hr/>

<h2>Declare Your Variables At the Top !</h2>
<pre>
Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.
If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).
To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.

<script>
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element
var x; // Declare x

var x1 = 5;  // Initialize x
elem = document.getElementById("demo1");            // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = "x1 is " + x1 + " and y1 is " + y1;    // Display x and y
var y1 = 7;  // Initialize y
</script>
