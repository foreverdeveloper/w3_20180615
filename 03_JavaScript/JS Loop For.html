<h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>
<pre>
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
<h3>The For Loop</h3>
	for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
	    code block to be executed
	}
	Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
		Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0).
		This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional.
		You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma):
	Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
		Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.
		This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional.
		If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.
		<b>If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop.
		Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.</b>
	Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
		Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.
		This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.
		Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.
		Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):

<h2>The For/In Loop</h2>
<pre>
The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object:
	var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

	var text = "";
	var x;
	for (x in person) {
	    text += person[x];
	}
</pre>
<p id="demo1"></p>
<hr/>


<script>
var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
var i, len, text;
for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
    text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;

var txt = "";
var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
var x;
for (x in person) {
    txt += person[x] + " ";
}
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = txt;

</script>
