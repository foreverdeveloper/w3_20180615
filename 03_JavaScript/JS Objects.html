<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
<pre>
JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal
Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines.

Object Properties
	The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

Object Methods
	Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

	var person = {
	    firstName: "John",
	    lastName : "Doe",
	    id       : 5566,
	    fullName : function() {
	        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
	    }
	};

	The this Keyword
		In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
		In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
		In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.

Accessing Object Properties
	1. objectName.propertyName
	2. objectName["propertyName"]

Accessing Object Methods
	objectName.methodName()
	예) name = person.fullName();
			name = person.fullName; // ()가 없으면 함수 정의를 리턴함.

Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
	When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

	var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
	var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
	var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
       return this.firstName + " " + this["lastName"];
    }
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
	person.fullName();

</script>
