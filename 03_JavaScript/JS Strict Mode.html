<h2>JavaScript Use Strict</h2>
<pre>
<b>"use strict";</b> Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

<h3>The "use strict" Directive</h3>
The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).
It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
Strict mode is supported in:
	IE from version 10. Firefox from version 4.
	Chrome from version 13. Safari from version 5.1.
	Opera from version 12.
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Declaring Strict Mode</h2>
<pre>
Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode)
	"use strict";
	x = 3.14;       // This will cause an error because x is not declared
<br/>
	// Declared inside a function, it has local scope (only the code inside the function is in strict mode)
	function myFunction() {
	   "use strict";
	    y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error
	}
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>The "use strict"; Syntax</h2>
<pre>
The syntax, for declaring strict mode, was designed to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript.
Compiling a numeric literal (4 + 5;) or a string literal ("John Doe";) in a JavaScript program has no side effects. It simply compiles to a non existing variable and dies.
So "use strict"; only matters to new compilers that "understand" the meaning of it.
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Why Strict Mode?</h2>
<pre>
Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.
In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>Not Allowed in Strict Mode</h2>
<pre>
Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
	"use strict";
	x = 3.14;                // This will cause an error
Objects are variables too.  Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed:
	x = {p1:10, p2:20};      // This will cause an error
Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
	var x = 3.14;
	delete x;                // This will cause an error
Deleting a function is not allowed.
	function x(p1, p2) {};
	delete x;                // This will cause an error
Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
	function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error
Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
	var x = 010;             // This will cause an error
Octal escape characters are not allowed:
	var x = "\010";            // This will cause an error
Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:
	var obj = {};
	Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", {value:0, writable:false});
	obj.x = 3.14;            // This will cause an error
Writing to a get-only property is not allowed:
	var obj = {get x() {return 0} };
	obj.x = 3.14;            // This will cause an error
Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
	delete Object.prototype; // This will cause an error
The string "eval" cannot be used as a variable:
	var eval = 3.14;         // This will cause an error
The string "arguments" cannot be used as a variable:
	var arguments = 3.14;    // This will cause an error
The with statement is not allowed:
	with (Math){x = cos(2)}; // This will cause an error
For security reasons, eval() is not allowed to create variables in the scope from which it was called:
In function calls like f(), the this value was the global object. In strict mode, it is now undefined.
	eval ("var x = 2");
	alert (x);               // This will cause an error

<h2>Future Proof!</h2>
<pre>
Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.
These are:
	implements
	interface
	let
	package
	private
	protected
	public
	static
	yield
	ex) var public = 1500;      // This will cause an error
</pre>





<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;    // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
</script>
