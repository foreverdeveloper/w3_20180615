<h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
<pre>
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

	Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
	Names must begin with a letter
	Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
	Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
	Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

</pre>

<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>You can declare many variables in one statement.</p>
<p id="demo1"></p>

<pre>
If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings,
and concatenated.

</pre>
<p>The result of adding 2 + 3 + "5":</p>
<p id="demo"></p>


<p>A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.</p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.</p>
<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
var person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = carName;

var x = 2 + 3 + "5"
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

var carName;
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = carName;

var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = carName;
