<h2>jQuery - Chaining</h2>
<pre>
With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods.
Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement.

Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).
However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).
Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.
To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.
	ex) $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
</pre>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
    });
});
</script>
<p id="p1">jQuery is fun!!</p>
<button>Click me</button>

Tip: When chaining, the line of code could become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations.
jQuery throws away extra whitespace and executes the lines above as one long line of code.

	$("#p1").css("color", "red")
	  .slideUp(2000)
	  .slideDown(2000);
</pre>
